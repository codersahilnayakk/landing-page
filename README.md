# Internship-Project-Interactive-E-Learning-Platform-with-React.js
As part of my internship project, I am developing an interactive and responsive e-learning platform using React.js, inspired by The Wise Blend. This project showcases my skills in modern web development, focusing on adaptive design, user-friendly interfaces, and seamless functionality to create an engaging learning experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
